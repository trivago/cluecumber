# Cluecumber Maven Example

This project demonstrates the usage of [Cluecumber Maven](../../maven).

This test project always uses the latest Cluecumber version.

## Configuration options

The whole plugin configuration is managed via the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file in this test project.
You can add different options as explained in the [Cluecumber Maven Readme](../../maven).

## Run the project

To run the project you need to have at least Java 11 and Maven 3.3.9 installed on your system.

Just run the Maven command ```mvn clean verify``` to see the report generation of Cluecumber in action.

The example Cucumber JSON files are located in the project's `json` directory. These are based on the https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-json-formatter project.
The report is generated inside the `target/cluecumber-report` directory.
