# Cluecumber

This project creates aggregated test reports from Cucumber compatible JSON files that are generated
by [Cucumber BDD](https://github.com/cucumber), [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) and other frameworks.

## Prerequisites

In order to have the JSON files as a source for the Cluecumber Report generation, you need to specify this option in
your Cucumber runner configuration:

```
@CucumberOptions(
    plugin = {"json:target/cucumber-report/cucumber.json"}
)
```

This will generate JSON results for all Cucumber tests.

## Cluecumber Core (usage from Java code)

[Cluecumber Core](core) is intended to be used directly from Java code, e.g.
for [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) test runners.

Please check out the documentation here: [Cluecumber Core documentation](core)

For an example, please check out the [Cluecumber Core Example](examples/core-example).

## Cluecumber Maven (usage from Maven)

[Cluecumber Maven](maven) is intended to be used through Maven invocation.

Please check out the documentation here: [Cluecumber Maven](maven)

For an example, please check out the [Cluecumber Maven Example](examples/maven-example).

## Example report

A fully generated example report can also be [viewed online](http://cluecumber.softwaretester.blog/)!

## Changelog

All changes are documented in the [full changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
