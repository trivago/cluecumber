# Cluecumber Core Example

This project demonstrates the usage of [Cluecumber Core](../../core).

This test project always uses the latest Cluecumber version.

## Configuration options

This example uses the default configuration for all options. You can add different options to the builder explained in the [Cluecumber Core Readme](../../core).

## Run the project

To run the project you need to have at least Java 11 and Maven 3.3.9 installed on your system.

Just execute the `Main` class to see the report generation of Cluecumber in action.

The example Cucumber JSON files are located in the project's `json` directory. These are based on the https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-json-formatter project.
The report is generated inside the `target/cluecumber-report` directory.

__Note:__ The report directory is not automatically wiped when regenerating the report.
