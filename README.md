# Cluecumber
_Clear and concise JVM and Maven reporting for the Cucumber BDD JSON format_

This project creates aggregated test reports from Cucumber compatible JSON files that are generated
by [Cucumber BDD](https://github.com/cucumber), [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) and other frameworks.

Cluecumber comes in two flavors:
* [__Cluecumber Core__](core) -  generates reports from Java code
* [__Cluecumber Maven__](maven) - generates reports from Maven

A fully generated example report can be [viewed here](https://softwaretester.blog/cluecumber)!

## Generated pages

Cluecumber generates the following report pages:

* __All Scenarios__: all scenarios grouped by their status `passed`, `failed` or `skipped`.
* __Scenario Sequence__: all scenarios in running order including their individual status information
* __Scenario Details__: all steps, hooks, stack traces and attachments of a single scenario
* __All Features__: an overview of all features
* __All Tags__: all used tags in scenarios, features and example tables including their individual status information
* __All Steps__: all steps in use including their individual status information
* __Scenarios by Tag__: all scenarios including a specific tag
* __Scenarios by Feature__: all scenarios belonging to a specific feature
* __Scenario by Step__: all scenarios that include a specific step
* __Tree View__: all features and scenarios in a tree for an easy overview of the test suite
